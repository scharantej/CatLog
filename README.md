## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- **cats.html**: This file will display a list of cats and their breeds. It will contain the necessary HTML structure and placeholders to dynamically display the data from the Flask routes.
- **breeds.html**: This file will display detailed information about a specific cat breed. It will be used when a user clicks on a cat in the **cats.html** file.

### Routes

- **@app.route('/cats')**: This route will handle the request for the list of cats and their breeds. It will query the database (assuming data is stored in a database) and return the HTML file **cats.html** with the populated data.
- **@app.route('/breeds/<breed_id>')**: This route will handle the request for information about a specific cat breed. It will query the database for the breed with the given **breed_id** and return the HTML file **breeds.html** with the breed information.
